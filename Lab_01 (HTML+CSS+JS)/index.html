                        <span>Beaches:</span> Of course, everyone comes here for the beaches. Miami is proud of its strips of soft sand, equipped with everything you might need for a fabulous beach day. The number one beach in the city is Miami Beach, situated across Biscayne Bay on a barrier reef. South Beach is also a very popular destination, situated along the coast of Florida.

                        <span>Museums and Landmarks:</span> Not many tourists come here for the museums but once they arrive here, the curiosity pushes them towards museums such as Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, an estate built in a European style, where visitors can admire art and furnishings, and the <a href="#">Lowe Art Museum,</a>, a museum dedicated to art, ceramics and pottery dating from ancient times to present. Miami is also home to an ancient Spanish Monastery, built in Segovia, Spain in 1141, brought and assembled here in 1954.

                <p class="main-text">
                        <span>Outdoor Fun:</span> The beaches are the number one setting for outdoor fun, with many nightclubs and bars inviting visitors to dance on the sand, but you can also visit the <a href="#">Oleta River State Recreation Park</a>, ideal for biking, canoeing, kayaking and other fun sports that can be played outdoors, and Jungle Island, a tropical garden that presents animal shows and exhibits. <a href="#">The Matheson Hammock Marina</a> is a beautiful park where you can discover a man-made atoll pool. If you want to admire impressive architecture you can also visit Star Island, an artificial island where many celebrities live.
