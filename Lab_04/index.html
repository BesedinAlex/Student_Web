                I'm <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alexey Besedin</span> and I love computers. I was a young kid when I first experienced such thing as a computer.
                The only things I needed computer for were games, movies and TV shows.
                While I was getting older, I bought a lot of games which I could play for hours.<br>
                When I was about ten or eleven years old, I watched Stargate TV series. It was an amazing show.
                I really love it. When I got tired a bit of watching, I wanted to use something like Stargate.
                Of course such a device don't exist in real life, but my family had an brand new back in days iPad 2 where was an easy
                accessible YouTube app. I googled and watched a lot of videos with Stargate used in some game, but couldn't find which
                game it is. After googling it, which wasn't a habbit for me, I eventually found out the game is
                <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod>Garry's Mod</a> and Stargate is just an addon by fans.
                I tried to find ways to download and enjoy such a game, but this game costs money and I have never experienced
                spending money online before. I found out that I can obtain this game in Steam and I only needed a card. I didn't have
                one. My father did. He still does. He always has a card where he stores the only amount of money he needs for one
                purchase so his money couldn't be stolen even if the card is compromised. So I did buy the game, downloaded the game
                with addon and began to play.<br>There's also such an addon which allows you to connect things with Arduino alike chip.
                You can make a simple program, connect it to devices you want to control or read some info from and enjoy.
                I knew nothing of programming. I always considered it an absolutely hard thing, but I realized that the only way
                I can improve my experince is make my own chips. So I started to copy codes of other people, tried to realize it,
                could make some minor changes and watched what changes. When I started to get what is going on and how it really works,
                I started to make my own codes. Of course they were a disaster, they were hardly readeble and other problems. But
                I tried to make them better, tried to discuss with people who knew how to program things right. At least I thought
                they knew.<br>I spent loads of time trying to make something interesting. In school I had no problems when we were
                studying Pascal. I really decided I want to connect my life with IT at the end. All because of this TV show that led me
                to this game that led me to programming. I might not become the best programmer in the world, at least because there's
                a ton of things you can program, like plugins, web pages, computer games, etc, but I'm surely will do my best to become
                better.
